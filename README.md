# Directed-Graphs
Implementation of a directed graph is very similar to the implementation of an undirected graph. The difference is that now due to directed edges, it matters which vertex the edge is pointing out of and to which vertex it is pointing into; when an edge is added we make sure to add the adj vertex only to the linked list of the vertex where the edge is pointing from. Traversals for a directed graph are basically the same, except with differnet nomenclature (DiGraph). Topological sort helps solve the problem dealing with precendence constraints; that is in what order do we have to solve the tasks in - this is a perfect exampple if you want to know the order of classes to take in order to graduate college. Topological sort can only work if there are no cycles; self explanatory becuase how would we graduate if there is a cycle? Topological sort cant be solved using basic dfs. We create a reverse post order of the vertices and put them on the stack. This can be done in time proportional to V + E. Strong connected components also helps us solve the client query, is there a directed path from v to w and from w to v; it answers this question in constant time - linear time processing using the constructor and constant time client query methods. This problem can be solved using Kosaraju-Sharir's algorithm; take the reverse graph and run topological sort on it; then run dfs on the ordering you get from the topological sort.
